According to the time values given after passing in each array size from tiny to extra large to the insert and append functions we can see that the insert function tends to run longer than the append function, the size of the array passed in typically means that the difference will only be much larger as we scale upward. We can see this scaling pattern when we compare the difference in time between the tiny array being passed into the two functions where it took 7.7 milliseconds to insert and 7.5 milliseconds to append. Yet when we move on to passing in the extra large array into the two functions the difference is substabtial where it takes an average of 658 milliseconds to insert and 3 milliseconds to append. The reason why the insert function is slower than the append function is because of the use of unshift() vs push(). The insert function uses the unshift() method which cannot simply place a new item at the zeroeth index without having to shift every other index up to make space for the new item at index 0, whereas push() can go right ahead and place a new item at the end of the array without having to move every other index to make space.
